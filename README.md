Practical Work II – Fundamentals of Informatic Engineering

Development:
•	I started creating the repository with the README and the LICENSE, then the folder and finally the index.html.
•	I then went ahead and started on the HTML structure for the following pages:
o	About.html
o	Degree.html
o	Contact.html
o	Net.html
o	Fce.html
o	Topic.html
•	After completing the structure, I created and applied individual CSS files for each page, making sure the navigation bar was consistent throughout, as initially only the index.html had one.
•Finally, I fixed some issues with the links and added the functionality to go back to index.html when clicking the title of the web.

Issues/Problems along the way:
•	Because I didn’t consider CSS from the beginning, I had to change some code on the pages when implementing the CSS.
•	Also, handling separate CSS files proved more complex than expected. I ran into some stubborn issues with the navbar, which took longer to fix than I’d like to admit — but I eventually solved them.

Conclusion:
Even though it's a basic webpage, this project turned out to be more challenging than it seemed. It requires more than just knowledge of HTML and CSS — it takes planning, consistency, and attention to detail.
That said, it’s a great way to apply what we’ve learned in class. And despite the difficulties, it ended up being a really fun and rewarding experience
