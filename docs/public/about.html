                <p>
                    My name is Jeronimo Gast, I'm a Colombian and German Computer Engineering student at Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (UFV).
                    This mix of, not only nationalities but also cultures has made me open to new experiences and cultures and built me into the person I am today.
                    I would describe myself as an extroverted and open minded person. I like to meet new people, and, by nature, am very curious!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for my hobbies and interests, I love traveling! As I said before, I love to meet and understand new cultures. This also means that I love traveling, and one of my biggest goals in life is to visit as many countries as I possibly can!
                    I also love to walk. My mom taught me that the best way to get to know a new city or country is to walk it and get lost in it!
                    I'm also what I would call a "Chef in process". This is because I love to cook, even if I'm not the best at it!

                <h2>My first year at UFV</h2>
                <p>
                    I cannot deny that when I first boarded that plane to come to study in Madrid I was terrified. What if I couldn't make any friends? What if I couldn't adapt myself to the culture? What if I was too rushed about my decision?
                    And even though it hasn't been easy, there's one thing I know for sure. This was the best decision I have ever made!
                    Yes, I struggled a bit (well, maybe a lot), to try to catch up to my Spanish peers as I realized they were WAY more advanced than I was in terms like math. And other subjects were not easier. Each subject would challenge me in a different way.
                    For some time, I felt defeated. I felt like it was too much and no matter how I tried, I just couldn't do it.
                    It also didn't help that my body defenses were apparently not prepared for Madrid as I got sick, probably, more in this year than in my entire life.
                    But the friends I made pushed me into giving it my all and not giving up. And so I did. And although results for the first Semester were... less than ideal, I focused on my second Semester and saw a big improvement!
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all, I can confidently say that I won't be giving up soon. I plan on proving I can make it here!
