            <h2>What is Freestyle Rap?</h2>
            <p>
                Freestyle rap is a form of improvised rap where lyrics are thought about on the spot and in front of an audience. No writing, no preparing and no thinking about it until the second you start rapping.
                The main goal is to outwit your opponents and impress both the public and the judges with clever wordplay, impressive flows or devastating punchlines.

            <h2>Its Origins</h2>
            <p>
                Freestyle is not new by any means. It started aroound the 1980s in the US during the early hip-hop culture.
                However, its evolution to freestyle battles how we know them to be, didn't happen (or at least take off) in the US. Rather, freestyle battling found a home in Spain and Latin America, where rappers would start performing for small, yet enthusiastic crowds in parks and public spaces. This eventually led to freestyle battling having such a growth and impact that events are now streamed through various platforms and reach insane numbers of viewers.
